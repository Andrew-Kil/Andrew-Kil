# Andrew Kil

Hi, I'm Andrew.

I'm a Software Engineer and I'm looking for opportunities to join a team and improve the lives of others with technology.

I'm currently working on a few different projects including a platform to share recipes as well as a blog that I started recently.

At the moment I'm learning GraphQL, MongoDB, and Gatsby.

In my free time, I enjoy watching food shows, playing games, and solving coding challenges on Codewars.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or want to collaborate on a project!
